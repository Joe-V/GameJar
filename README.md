GameJar aims to be a simple object-oriented 2D game engine based on the concept of a game world made up of entities. It is currently a work in progress.

Current features include:
- The concept of a game world consisting of a number of independent entities that can move around in a world coordinate system independent of the physical coordinate system used for drawing.
- A basic graphics system that uses offscreen rendering, with a window that supports full-screen mode.
